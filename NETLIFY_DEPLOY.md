# Netlify Deployment Instructions

## Ready to Deploy

Your project is now properly configured for Netlify deployment. The build error has been fixed.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Trading signals dashboard ready for deployment"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Select GitHub and choose your repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## What's Fixed

- ✅ Production Vite config without Replit-specific plugins
- ✅ Direct build command in netlify.toml bypassing npm scripts
- ✅ Serverless function rewritten without external dependencies
- ✅ Pure Node.js implementation for Netlify Functions
- ✅ API endpoints working with realistic trading data
- ✅ CORS headers configured for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Removed all dependency issues causing build failures

## Expected Build Output

- Frontend: `dist/public/` (React app)
- API: `netlify/functions/server.js` (Express serverless function)
- Routes: All `/api/*` requests go to serverless function

## After Deployment

Your trading signals dashboard will be live with:
- Real-time signal generation
- 6 trading platforms support
- Professional dark theme
- Mobile responsive design
- Free trial system

## Custom Domain

After successful deployment, you can connect your custom domain in Netlify settings.
